### summernote-plugins a Guide
Step by Step Guide on adding and creating Plugins for [Summernote](https://github.com/summernote/summernote/)

There is a lot of confusion on how to not only add plugins and make them useable within the Summernote Editor, but also how to create them, and how to interact with data in the editor.

This repository will hopefully help to dispell, and make understanding how to add, use, and create plugins.

For those that already know how to add, use, and create plugins, I urge you to visit [Awesome Summernote](https://github.com/summernote/awesome-summernote), a repository of links to some great plugins, and other examples.

We welcome pull requests if you find information lacking or containing errors, or if you think something is missing.

To get started visit our [wiki](https://github.com/DiemenDesign/summernote-plugins/wiki)
